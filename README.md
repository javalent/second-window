Also known as **Image Window**, this plugin allows you to open a note or image file in your vault in a new pop-up Obsidian window.

## Quickstart

Notes and images can be opened in this way by right-clicking on them or their links, and selecting "**Open in New window**."

Alternatively, they can be opened if the Core Plugin [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette "Obsidian") is enabled, using the "**Open Image in New Window**" command.

## Why Use the Second Window Plugin?

The Second Window plugin is an enhancement to Obsidian's New Window functionality that adds features missing from the default behaviour. Here are a few examples:

-   When you request to "Open an Image in the Second Window," the plugin will send it to the existing Second Window that is already open. This way, you can set up the second window on a player-facing screen and leave it there.
-   The plugin stretches the images to the full size of the window, while Obsidian's "New Window" opens them in the default size. This allows you to view images more comfortably without having to adjust the zoom or window size manually.
